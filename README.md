# Notes

After reviewing both tests, to even my own surprise i decided to choose the front-end test.
This was due to lack of experience with using PHP and SQL.
However, i did look at a working example of the back-end test to gain an understanding of it, and will definitely be looking into PHP and SQL in the future.

I chose to use React to build this website as it allows components to be re-used throughout the app, and it's a framework that im comfortable using.
No frameworks were used for CSS.

## Improvements

With more time i would create a hamburger-menu for the nav-bar for smaller devices.
I would also change/add more animations/hover effects.
I also struggled to find the correct icon for the 'number of people' section of the form. Hopefully the one i used was close enough!

## Final thoughts

This was definitely a challenge, i had fun putting it all together and it was a great learning oppurtunity.
I look forward to your feedback!
